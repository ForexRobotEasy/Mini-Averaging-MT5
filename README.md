# Mini Averaging MT5

This is a code example for the Mini Averaging MT5 expert advisor developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. 

## Product Description

Mini Averaging MT5 is a high-risk forex strategy software designed to open positions based on the Super Averaging or Mini Averaging strategy. The expert advisor provides two options: one with grid and martingale features enabled and another without them. 

With grid and martingale enabled, the expert advisor follows the Super Averaging strategy, opening positions at certain price levels with a grid structure and using martingale principles to manage risk and maximize profit potential. 

On the other hand, without grid and martingale, the expert advisor focuses on the Mini Averaging strategy, opening positions based on specific criteria without the use of grid or martingale techniques.

## How it Works

The expert advisor consists of several functions and variables:

### Indicator Files

The code includes the following indicator files:
- MovingAverages.mqh
- MoneyFlowIndex.mqh
- MACD.mqh

These indicator files provide necessary functions for the expert advisor to analyze market data.

### Global Variables

The expert advisor uses the following global variables:
- `MA_Period` - Moving Average period
- `MFI_Period` - Money Flow Index period
- `MACD_Fast` - MACD Fast EMA period
- `MACD_Slow` - MACD Slow EMA period
- `MACD_Signal` - MACD Signal SMA period
- `Risk_Percentage` - Risk percentage for position sizing

These variables can be adjusted by the user to customize the expert advisor's behavior.

### Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is called during the expert advisor's initialization. This function can be used to initialize any necessary variables or perform other setup tasks.

### Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert advisor is being deinitialized. This function can be used to clean up any resources or perform other tasks before the expert advisor is shut down.

### Start Function

The `OnTick()` function is the main entry point of the expert advisor. It is called on every tick of the selected currency pair. Inside this function, the trading logic is implemented based on whether grid and martingale features are enabled or not.

- If grid and martingale features are enabled (`IsGridAndMartingaleEnabled()` returns `true`), the expert advisor opens a position using the Super Averaging strategy with grid and martingale. The specific logic for opening positions with grid and martingale should be added to the `OpenPositionWithGridAndMartingale()` function.
- If grid and martingale features are not enabled (`IsGridAndMartingaleEnabled()` returns `false`), the expert advisor opens a position using the Mini Averaging strategy without grid and martingale. The specific logic for opening positions without grid and martingale should be added to the `OpenPositionWithoutGridAndMartingale()` function.

### Grid and Martingale Features

The `IsGridAndMartingaleEnabled()` function is responsible for checking if grid and martingale features are enabled. This function should contain the logic to determine if these features should be used or not. In the provided code, it always returns `true`, indicating that grid and martingale are enabled.

### Opening Positions with Grid and Martingale

The `OpenPositionWithGridAndMartingale()` function is called when grid and martingale features are enabled. Inside this function, the logic for opening positions with grid and martingale should be implemented. The provided code includes a placeholder comment indicating that a position has been opened with grid and martingale.

### Opening Positions without Grid and Martingale

The `OpenPositionWithoutGridAndMartingale()` function is called when grid and martingale features are not enabled. Inside this function, the logic for opening positions without grid and martingale should be implemented. The provided code includes a placeholder comment indicating that a position has been opened without grid and martingale.

Please note that the provided code does not include the complete trading logic for the Super Averaging or Mini Averaging strategies. The logic for opening positions, managing risk, and closing positions should be added according to the specific strategy requirements.
